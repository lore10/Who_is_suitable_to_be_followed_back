# Who_is_suitable_to_be_followed_back
Dataset used in the project "Who is suitable to be followed back when you are a Twitter interested in Politics?" 
Conference dg.o 2017.

Twitter users might be characterized as highly politically active or poorly politically active citizens, 
according to their Twitter activity. Identifying the level of interest in politics of a user would be relevant 
to provide them with meaningful recommendations such as political actors to follow, tweets talking about politics, 
and political-oriented lists, among others. However, due to the information overload and the wide range of topics 
posted on Twitter, generating personalized political-related suggestions becomes a problem.
